    <!-- <p class="text">You may want to stop an application for a grant of probate when:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet text">

        <li>you think the person who made the will was being influenced by someone else or was not able to make their own decisions</li>
        <li>the person applying for probate refuses to share a copy of the will with you</li>
        <li>you think the person applying won’t be able to carry out the instructions in the will</li>
        <li>you think the person applying is not eligible to apply if there was no will (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inherits-someone-dies-without-will">who inherits if there is no will</a>)</li>

      </ul>
    <p class="text">These are the most common reasons, but there may be other reasons too.</p> -->

    <!-- <p class="text">You should not stop an application for a grant of probate if you want to challenge whether adequate financial provision has been made for you by the person who died. You would need to make a claim under the ‘Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975’ instead. -->
